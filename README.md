# Exploratory Data Analysis


## The purpose of this project is explorative data analysis. Where based on the customers journey, expendature, visit frequency, analysis was done and findings were visualized. 


### Methods used:
* Bivariate analysis
*** Bivariate analysis is a statistical analysis technique that focuses on exploring the relationship between two variables. It examines how changes in one variable are related to changes in another variable. Bivariate analysis commonly involves plotting the variables on a scatter plot and analyzing the correlation or association between them. It helps in understanding the strength, direction, and nature of the relationship between two variables.
* Univariate analysis
*** Univariate analysis is a statistical analysis technique that focuses on analyzing a single variable at a time. It aims to describe and summarize the characteristics, distribution, and patterns of a single variable. Common methods used in univariate analysis include measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation), frequency distributions, and graphical representations such as histograms and box plots. 
* Multivariate analysis
*** Multivariate analysis is a statistical analysis technique that involves the simultaneous analysis of multiple variables. It aims to understand the relationships among three or more variables and explore complex interactions between them.

### Language stack:
